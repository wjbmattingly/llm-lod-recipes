# Entity Disambiguation

## What is Entity Disambiguation?

Entity disambiguation, also known as Entity Linking or Entity Resolution, is the process of determining which specific real-world entity a mention in text refers to when multiple entities could match that mention. It's the crucial step that connects named entity mentions identified by NER systems to specific entries in knowledge bases or linked open data resources.

## The Core Problem

Consider the ambiguous mention "Washington" in these sentences:
- "Washington signed the Declaration of Independence" → **George Washington** (Person)
- "I'm flying to Washington next week" → **Washington, D.C.** (Place)  
- "Washington won the game last night" → **Washington Commanders** (Sports Team)
- "The University of Washington is in Seattle" → **University of Washington** (Organization)

Entity disambiguation resolves this ambiguity by selecting the correct entity from a knowledge base.

## Key Components

### Knowledge Base
A structured repository of entities with unique identifiers:
- **Wikidata**: Collaborative knowledge base with millions of entities
- **DBpedia**: Structured information from Wikipedia
- **YAGO**: Knowledge base combining Wikipedia and WordNet
- **Custom KBs**: Domain-specific knowledge bases

### Entity Mentions
Text spans identified by NER that potentially refer to KB entities:
- **Surface Forms**: Different ways an entity can be mentioned
- **Context**: Surrounding text that provides disambiguating information
- **Aliases**: Alternative names for the same entity

### Candidate Generation
Finding potential KB entities that could match a mention:
- **String Matching**: Exact and fuzzy matching of mention text
- **Alias Lookup**: Using known alternative names
- **Phonetic Similarity**: Matching based on pronunciation
- **Popularity Priors**: Considering frequency of entity usage

## Disambiguation Approaches

### Context-Based Methods

#### Local Context
Using words immediately surrounding the mention:
- **Bag of Words**: Term frequency in local context
- **TF-IDF**: Weighted term importance
- **Word Embeddings**: Dense vector representations

#### Global Context  
Considering the entire document or broader context:
- **Topic Models**: Document-level topic classification
- **Coherence**: Ensuring selected entities are related
- **Entity Graphs**: Leveraging connections between entities

### Feature-Based Approaches
Traditional machine learning using engineered features:
- **String Similarity**: Edit distance, Jaccard coefficient
- **Popularity**: Entity frequency in knowledge base
- **Type Compatibility**: Matching expected entity types
- **Contextual Features**: POS tags, dependency relations

### Neural Approaches

#### Embedding-Based Methods
- **Entity Embeddings**: Dense representations of KB entities
- **Context Embeddings**: Neural representations of mention context
- **Similarity Scoring**: Cosine similarity between embeddings

#### End-to-End Neural Models
- **LSTM/GRU**: Sequence models for context encoding
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus on relevant context parts
- **Transformer Models**: BERT-based disambiguation systems
